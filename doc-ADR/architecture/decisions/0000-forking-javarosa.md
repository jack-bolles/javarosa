# 0. Forking JavaRosa

Accepted

## Context

JavaRosa has been stable for many years. While functional, from a technical perspective it could use a bit of TLC. The Java has moved on, some of its libraries and tooling could use an upgrade, and it may benefit from moving from a procedural approach to a more functional style of programming.

Separately, Iâ€™ve been on the front lines of the refugee crisis in Europe and on the Mediterranean. I wanted to apply my professional skills on something that impacts humanitarian aid. There are a couple open source projects out there that are being actively developed, and contributing to one of them was my first consideration. I was hoping that I could find one using Kotlin or at least actively moving towards it. I was looking at a few java projects (ODK, OpenMRS, DHIS2). What finally pushed me in the direction of JavaRosa was this thread on ODK's [slack](https://getodk.slack.com/archives/C35ENHA64/p1683242586538609)

Reviewing JavaRosa's codebase, it was a good combination of a
- codebase with a fairly strong test-suite, precursors for getting up to speed quickly _and_ having a safety net, especially for edge cases
- it's coding style doesn't match the modern java approach, relies on deprecated code and dependencies that need paying attention-to.
- stable functionality means I could focus on my craft-of-coding skills

Finally, I am between projects (I tend to work as a contractor) and wanted a project that I could do on my own time, and pick up and put down as my situation allowed.

## Decision

Start with an area of the codebase that needs updating from a technical approach and deprecation perspective that should have no impact on functional capability of the system as a whole.

Upgrading to `java.time.*` approach to dates and time seemed to be a choice that fit all the criteria. Within that, I wanted to temporarily retain _**but isolate**_ use of `java.util.Date` to the edge where XPath Expressions are interpreted, and replace `Jodatime` with the `java.time.*` "library". A future effort could like completing the move from `java.util` to `java.time`

## Consequences

At a minimum, it's an opportunity for me to skill up and improve my craftmanship on a feature rich codebase.

At best, the ODK project team finds it useful and I make a positive contribution to society.
